#+END_COMMENT

* Introduction
  Historically java developers was dominated by IDEs and heavy programs(AKA jetbrains stuffs),
  but now with the lsp-mode for emacs, we have an easy to setup and power engine to produce java code
  with all others IDEs offers, like autocompletion, go to definition, code actions, refactor options
  and something that IDEs don't have, *A powerful keyboard center experience and high extensibility*

* Setting Emacs for basic usage
  I'll assume you don't know anything about emacs and want to know about this wonderful
  elisp interpreter.

** Installing
   First, to install emacs is simple enough to install with your package manager

   For Ubuntu/Debian based distros:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo apt-get install emacs
   #+END_SRC

   For Arch based distros:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo pacman -S emacs
   #+END_SRC

   For OSX:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   brew cask install emacs
   #+END_SRC

   If you use other system, see in this link: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html

** Basic settings
   Emacs default is quite ugly, like *trust me* it's ugly
   [[img-url:/images/emacs-default.png]]

   So let's make this look nicer and also learn some cool things about emacs.
   First open emacs and type =C-x C-f= where C is shortcut for Control(Ctrl), this
   brings you a minibuffer on the bottom where you can find files, type =~/.emacs.d/init.el=
   and hit Enter /this is your main config file/.

   Now let's prettify a little bit this editor, write this in the file:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (scroll-bar-mode -1)
     (tool-bar-mode -1)
     (menu-bar-mode -1)
     (setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
     (setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
     (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
   #+END_SRC

   To make this apply, press =M-x= where M stands for the Alt Key, type /eval-buffer/ and press Enter
